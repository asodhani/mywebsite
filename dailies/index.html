            I started a new section today, called <a href="/health">Health</a>. I'll be detailing the health issues I
            have and what I'm doing about them. I'll probably also talk about why I do some of the things that I do
            because they're not exactly "orthodox" procedures, and many go against what your trusted sources tell you.

            I just watched Bismuth's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjge1bVobN0">video</a> explaining the zero
            star speedrun.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIsn8pDH3qM">this video</a> where he explains his
            video making process. It was incredibly humbling.
        </p>
        <p>
            He puts so much effort into producing a video (an hour to perfectly record 3-4 minutes of audio!) then still
            apologises for not putting out content quickly enough AND that English is not his first language.
        </p>
        <p>
            Makes me wonder what I'm doing with all this time I have on my hands.

            Ate some gone-bad food for lunch today. I felt it in my head shortly after eating it. Put 3 heaping tbsp in
            8oz of water and drank half. It caused some stuff to go on in my stomache, but ended up throwing the food up
            anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's the third time in about a month I've eaten some bad stuff that brings me down. All three times it's
            been with Hello Fresh delivered meals that I've meal prepped and eaten about a week later. Food that I've
            prepared myself has gone as long as 3 weeks in the fridge before I ate it, and it went down just fine. There
            was even one dish that had mold growing on the top. My roommate, an experienced chef, told me to just pick
            it off and heat it up. It went down fine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Must be that Hello Fresh meals are not meant to be stored longer than a week in the fridge.

            Man, my ears are poppin off.
